# **Make it a habbit to spend time reading high-quality code that others have written.**

## 01 Introduction

* Start with any documentation you might find.
* When examining Java code consider using `AspectJ` to insert into the program code elements that will execute only under specific circumstances.
* The strategy for selectively dealing with parts of a large system is outlined below:    
    + Locate the code parts that interest you.
    + Understand the specific parts in isolation.
    + Infer the code excerpts's relationship with the rest of the code.
